### Git strategies

It was used Git Workflows and actions to provide speed on the Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (you can check them in the "actions" sections if you want). Furtheremore, it was used a kind of gitflow approach to provide stage segregation-driven environment (dev and production), but only following 3 kind of branches: features, develop and master.
